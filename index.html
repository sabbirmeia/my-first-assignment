            <p>My mission in 2022 is to finish this course in a good way.To go to SCIC .But I am very afrid because I
                have just finished SSC.I don't know if I can win SCIC.This course will help me a lot in the future.If I
                can't do anything at the end of the course,I will lern to drive.Because by 2022,the family will have to
                take care of it anyway.What else is this.</p><br>
